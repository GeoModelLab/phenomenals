Grapevine phenology cornerstone yield quality prediction, environmental conditions across two growing seasons influence reproductive development. Traditional forecasting models often focus single seasons fixed time windows, overlooking cumulative effects. PhenoMeNals addresses gap phenology-aware framework integrates: 🌱 Phenology simulation using BBCH observations weather data 🌡️ Eco-physiological functions capturing temperature, radiation, water balance, stress signals 📊 Statistical modeling cumulative environmental effects (memory signals) yield quality Validated across multi-site, multi-variety datasets, PhenoMeNals consistently achieved R² > 0.8 yield, yield components, quality traits. 📄 See full description PhenoMeNals paper:PhenoMeNals framework grapevine yield quality prediction (Bregaglio & Bajocco, 2025)  Figure 1.
