## üìñ Overview

**PhenoMeNals** is an open-source framework for **predicting grapevine yield and quality traits**.  
It integrates **two-season phenology modeling**, **ecophysiological functions**, and **statistical methods** to generate cumulative environmental memory signals (PhenoMeNals) driving reproductive processes.

## Highlights

- üå± **Two-season chill-forcing phenology model** (dormancy ‚Üí harvest)  
- üß† **8 environmental signals**:  
  `TempF`, `ColdF`, `HeatF`, `LightF`, `WindF`, `DiseaseF`, `VPDefF`, `DroughtF`  
- ‚öôÔ∏è Signals are **sigmoid-normalized**, **weighted by correlation** with target traits, and **aggregated into memory signals**  
- üî¨ Handles multicollinearity (VIF) and performs **automatic feature selection (AIC)**  
- ü™ü **Windows-only** (C# core) ‚Äì cross-platform support in development

## Description

**PhenoMeNals** addresses the challenge of integrating weather effects across grapevine's **two-year reproductive cycle**, where yield components are determined across multiple phenophases.

### Workflow

1. **Calibrate phenology:** BBCH observations calibrate a chill-forcing model providing a standardized phenological timeline (0‚Äì400 units across two seasons).
2. **Compute environmental functions:**  
   Each environmental driver is expressed as a daily function (e.g., temperature forcing, vapor pressure deficit stress, etc.).
3. **Normalize and weight:**  
   Signals are normalized using long-term percentile distributions and weighted by correlation strength with the target trait.
4. **Aggregate into memory signals:**  
   Weighted daily values are cumulatively summed along the phenological timeline to form the **PhenoMeNals**, which are then used as predictors.
