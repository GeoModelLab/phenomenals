## üìñ Overview
**PhenoMeNals** is a phenology-aware predictive framework for **grapevine yield and quality forecasting**, integrating **phenology simulation**, **eco-physiological functions**, and **statistical modeling**.  

The framework explicitly accounts for the **two-year reproductive cycle of grapevine**, combining a **dormancy-forcing phenology model** with cumulative ‚Äúmemory signals‚Äù derived from environmental cues (temperature, radiation, water status, biotic and abiotic stresses). These signals are aligned along a standardized phenological timeline and weighted by their correlation with yield- and quality-related traits, enabling **biologically meaningful predictions** and interpretation of carry-over effects.  

> **Note:** PhenoMeNals is released as an **R package** with **C# routines** invoked from R. It is currently available only on **Windows**, but cross-platform compatibility is under development.

## Description

Grapevine phenology is a cornerstone of yield and quality prediction, as environmental conditions across two growing seasons influence reproductive development. Traditional forecasting models often focus on single seasons or fixed time windows, overlooking these cumulative effects.

**PhenoMeNals** addresses this gap with a **phenology-aware framework** that integrates:

- üå± **Phenology simulation** using BBCH observations and weather data  
- üå°Ô∏è **Eco-physiological functions** capturing temperature, radiation, water balance, and stress signals  
- üìä **Statistical modeling** of cumulative environmental effects (*memory signals*) on yield and quality  

Validated across **multi-site, multi-variety datasets**, PhenoMeNals consistently achieved **R¬≤ > 0.8** for yield, yield components, and quality traits.

üìÑ **See the full description of PhenoMeNals in the paper**:  
*The PhenoMeNals framework for grapevine yield and quality prediction* (Bregaglio & Bajocco, 2025)

    <em>Figure 1. Overview of the PhenoMeNals workflow. The pipeline integrates BBCH observations and weather data to calibrate a phenological model reproducing the grapevine cycle across two seasons (Year -1 and Year 0). Eco-physiological functions are computed along this timeline and aggregated within phenological bins. Each signal is evaluated for its correlation with the target trait and normalized via sigmoid transformation. The resulting cumulative memory signals (PhenoMeNals) serve as predictors for Leave One Out Cross Validation (LOOCV) using multiple linear regression. Outputs include regression coefficients, variable importance and model diagnostics.</em>

PhenoMeNals organizes its workflow along the full **two-season grapevine cycle**:

### Year -1: Dormancy and Pre-Harvest Season
- ‚ùÑÔ∏è Chilling accumulation and dormancy release  
- üå∏ Early reproductive development (primordia differentiation and setup)

### Year 0: Harvest Season
- üåø Budburst, flowering, fruit set and ripening  
- üìà Environmental memory effects captured via cumulative eco-physiological signals  

### Environmental Memory Signals  
Eco-physiological functions (e.g., temperature suitability, drought stress, radiation limitation) are:
1. üîÑ Smoothed and aligned with phenological phases  
2. ‚öñÔ∏è Normalized and weighted by their correlation with the target trait  
3. ‚ûï Summed into **PhenoMeNals** ‚Äî cumulative indicators that drive the final prediction

> Cross-platform support (macOS/Linux) is under active development.

### 1. Install R

Make sure **R (version ‚â• 4.0)** is installed:  
üîó [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/)

### 2. Install Required R Packages

If your R environment does not already have **devtools**, install it first:

```r
install.packages("devtools")
```

### 3. Install PhenoMeNals from GitHub

You can install the PhenoMeNals package directly using devtools:
```r
devtools::install_github("GeoModelLab/phenomenals")
```

This will:

    Download the PhenoMeNals R package
    Compile and install it locally
    Include the precompiled C# backend executable required for model execution (Windows only, cross-platform support under development)

The C# source code for the phenology calibration engine is included in the repository under the /src directory. A precompiled Windows .exe is also bundled under inst/extdata/Windows/.

    üì¶ The R functions handle all the configuration and execution automatically by calling this backend executable.

---

## Getting Started

The **PhenoMeNals** framework is built around two functions:  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **`phenologyCalibration()`** ‚Äì calibrates the phenology model using BBCH field observations and weather data.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **`runPhenomenals()`** ‚Äì computes eco-physiological memory signals and predicts traits.

---

### 1. `phenologyCalibration()`

This function performs **calibration** of the PhenoMeNals phenology model using weather data and BBCH phenological observations.  
It automatically prepares input files and calls the embedded C# engine ‚Äî users do not need to handle configuration files manually.

---

#### **Example**

```r
result <- phenologyCalibration(
  weather_data = weather_df,              # hourly or daily weather data
  referenceBBCH = bbch_df,                # BBCH phenological observations
  phenomenalsParameters = phenomenalsParameters,  # parameter list
  start_year = 2010,
  end_year = 2020,
  sites = "ColliOrientali",               # or "all"
  varieties = "CabernetS",                # or "all"
  iterations = 300,
  timestep = "daily"                      # "daily" or "hourly"
)
```

# Outputs:
# result$parameters ‚Üí Calibrated parameter table (per site √ó variety)

## How it works

This section provides a detailed look at the internal mechanics of the SWELL model, including the mathematical and physiological functions used to simulate NDVI/EVI.

> üß† Recommended for advanced users and researchers interested in model structure and ecophysiological logic.

These are the functions used by SWELL to simulate the plant response to air temperature and photoperiod in different phenological phases.
<figure>

  <img src="./docs/images/all_functions.png" width="700">
  </p>
  <figcaption align="center"><em>Functions used to simulate the effect of photoperiod and temperature on plant phenological phases</em></figcaption>
</figure>

Every day and during phenophase _x_, a photothermal unit _PTU<sub>x</sub>_, (day<sup>-1</sup>, eq. 1) is computed, summed, and divided by the phenophase photothermal requirements _PTR<sub>x</sub>_ (days, eq. 2) to derive its percentage of completion _PC<sub>x</sub>_ (%). 

$$PTU_x = PU_x \times TU_x \tag{1}$$
$$PC_x = \frac{\sum_{1}^{n} PTU_x}{PTR_x} \times 100\tag{2}$$

where _PU<sub>x</sub>_ (0-1, day<sup>-1</sup>) and _TU<sub>x</sub>_ (0-1, day<sup>-1</sup>) are the photoperiodic and thermal components of _PTU<sub>x</sub>_, respectively, and _n_ is the number of days elapsed from the start of the _x_ phenophase. 

### Dormancy season
The [Dormancy induction](#dormancy-induction) is stimulated by short and cold days. Once induced, the dormancy season unfolds through [Endodormancy](#endodormancy), when chilling accumulation occurs, and [Ecodormancy](#ecodormancy), whose progress is promoted by longer days and warm temperatures.

#### Dormancy induction
The following equations (3 and 4) are used to draw the logistic function displayed in the figure below, which is used to estimate the photoperiodic unit for dormancy induction _PU<sub>DI</sub>_.

$$
P_{\mathrm{DI\_mid}} = 0.5 \cdot (P_{\mathrm{DI\_l}} + P_{\mathrm{DI\_nl}}) \tag{3}
$$

$$
PU_{\mathrm{DI}} = \begin{cases}
  0 & \text{if } D_l \geq P_{\mathrm{DI\_l}} \\
  1 & \text{if } D_l \leq P_{\mathrm{DI\_nl}} \\
  \frac{1}{1 + e^{10/(P_{\mathrm{DI\_l}} - P_{\mathrm{DI\_nl}}) \cdot (D_l - P_{\mathrm{DI\_mid}})}} & \text{elsewhere}
\end{cases} \tag{4}
$$

where _P<sub>DI\_mid</sub>_ (hours) is the midpoint of the logistic function increasing from _P<sub>DI\_l</sub>_ (hours) to _P<sub>DI\_nl</sub>_ (hours), i.e., the limiting and non-limiting day length for dormancy induction, respectively; _Dl_ (hours) is the day length.

<figure>
<p align="center">
  <img src="./docs/images/PU_DI_doc.png"  width="400">
  </p>
  <figcaption align="center"><em>Photoperiodic unit for dormancy induction. The shades correspond to the 40-60<sup>th</sup> and 25-75<sup>th</sup> percentiles of the distribution generated with limiting photoperiod ranging from 12 to 14.5 hours and non limiting photoperiod from 11.5 to 13 hours.</em></figcaption>
</figure>


The thermal unit for dormancy induction are derived with another logistic function, using equations 5 and 6.

$$
T_{\mathrm{DI\_mid}} = 0.5 \cdot (T_{\mathrm{DI\_l}} + T_{\mathrm{DI\_nl}}) \tag{5}
$$

$$
TU_{\mathrm{DI}} =
\begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } T \geq T_{\mathrm{DI\_l}} \\
1 & \text{if } T_{\mathrm{l}} \leq T_{\mathrm{DI\_nl}} \\
\frac{1}{1 + e^{10/(T_{\mathrm{DI\_l}} - T_{\mathrm{DI\_nl}}) \cdot (T - T_{\mathrm{DI\_mid}})}} & \text{elsewhere}
\end{cases}
\tag{6}
$$

where _T<sub>DI\_mid</sub>_ (¬∞C) is the midpoint of the logistic function increasing from _T<sub>DI\_l</sub>_ (¬∞C) to _T<sub>DI\_nl</sub>_ (¬∞C), i.e., the limiting and non-limiting temperature for dormancy induction, respectively; _T_ (¬∞C) is the average daily air temperature.

   <figcaption align="center"><em>Thermal units for dormancy induction. The shades correspond to the 40-60<sup>th</sup> and 25-75<sup>th</sup> percentiles of the distribution generated with limiting temperature ranging from 17 to 22 ¬∞C and non limiting temperatre from 3 to 8 ¬∞C.</em></figcaption>
</figure>

Each day, _PU<sub>DI</sub>_ and _TU<sub>DI</sub>_ are multiplied to give the daily photothermal unit of dormancy induction _PTU<sub>DI</sub>_ and the respective completion percentage _PC<sub>DI</sub>_

#### Endodormancy
After dormancy induction is completed, the endodormancy proceeds along with chilling units‚Äô accumulation, computed according to the following equations 7 and 8. The chilling units are computed hourly, therefore the daily dynamic of air temperature is simulated from daily maximum and minimum air temperature. For more details, you can refer to [Soil Physics with BASIC](https://shop.elsevier.com/books/soil-physics-with-basic/campbell/978-0-444-42557-7).

$$
CU_{\text{mid}} = 
\begin{cases}
  0.5 \cdot (T_{\mathrm{EN\_l}\downarrow} + T_{\mathrm{EN\_nl}\downarrow}) & \text{if } T_h \leq T_{\mathrm{EN\_nl}\downarrow} \leq T_{\mathrm{EN\_l}\downarrow}, \\
  0.5 \cdot (T_{\mathrm{EN\_l}\uparrow} + T_{\mathrm{EN\_nl}\uparrow}) & \text{if } T_{\mathrm{EN\_nl}\uparrow} \leq T_h \leq T_{\mathrm{EN\_l}\uparrow}.
\end{cases} \tag{7}
$$

$$
CU_{\text{EN}} =
\begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } T_h \leq T_{\mathrm{EN\_l}\downarrow} \text{ or } T_h \geq T_{\mathrm{EN\_l}\uparrow}, \\
1 & \text{if } T_{\mathrm{EN\_nl}\downarrow} \leq T_h \leq T_{\mathrm{EN\_nl}\uparrow}, \\
\frac{1}{1 + e^{-10/(T_{\mathrm{EN\_l}\downarrow} - T_{\mathrm{EN\_nl}\downarrow}) \cdot (T_h - CU_{\text{mid}})}} & \text{if } T_{\mathrm{EN\_l}\downarrow} < T_h < T_{\mathrm{EN\_nl}\downarrow}, \\
\frac{1}{1 + e^{10/(T_{\mathrm{EN\_l}\uparrow} - T_{\mathrm{EN\_nl}\uparrow}) \cdot (T_h - CU_{\text{mid}})}} & \text{if } T_{\mathrm{EN\_nl}\uparrow} < T_h < T_{\mathrm{EN\_l}\uparrow}.
\end{cases} \tag{8}
$$


where _T<sub>EN\_l‚Üì</sub>_ (¬∞C) and _T<sub>EN\_l‚Üë</sub>_ (¬∞C) are the lower and upper limiting temperature for chilling units accumulation, and _T<sub>EN\_nl‚Üì</sub>_ (¬∞C) and _T<sub>EN\_nl‚Üë</sub>_ (¬∞C) are the lower and upper not-limiting thresholds for chilling units accumulation. Daily chilling units (_CU<sub>EN\_d</sub>_, day<sup>-1</sup>) are computed summing _CU<sub>EN</sub>_ (hour<sup>-1</sup>), and the endodormancy completion (_PC<sub>EN</sub>_, %) is derived as for dormancy induction. 
The resulting function is displayed below.

<figure>
 <p align="center">
  <img src="./docs/images/CU_doc.png"  width="400">
  </p>
  <figcaption align="center"><em>Chilling units accumulation. The shades correspond to the 40-60<sup>th</sup> and 25-75<sup>th</sup> percentiles of the distribution generated with lower limiting chilling temperature ranging from -5 to -2 ¬∞C, lower non limiting chilling temperature from 1 to 5¬∞C, upper non limiting temperature from 2 to 6 ¬∞C and upper limiting temperature from 9 to 12 ¬∞C</em></figcaption>
</figure>


#### Ecodormancy
High _PC<sub>EN</sub>_ values accelerates the progress of the [ecodormancy](#ecodormancy) (_PTU<sub>EC_</sub>, day<sup>-1</sup>), whose completion is stimulated by long days and warm temperatures. The following equations 8-10 are used to estimate photothermal units during the ecodormancy phase.

$$
P_r = \frac{D_l}{P_{\mathrm{EC\_nl}}} \tag{9}
$$

$$
T_{\mathrm{EC\_mid}} = 0.5 \cdot T_{\mathrm{EC\_nl}} + (1 - P_r) \cdot T_{\mathrm{EC\_nl}} \tag{10}
$$

$$
PTU_{\mathrm{EC}} = \frac{PC_{\mathrm{EN}} + (1 - PC_{\mathrm{EN}}) \cdot P_r}{1 + e^{-10/(T_{\mathrm{EC\_nl}} \cdot P_r \cdot (T - T_{\mathrm{EC\_mid}}))}} \cdot \frac{1}{100} \tag{11}
$$

where _Pr_ is the ratio between _Dl_ and the not-limiting photoperiod for ecodormancy (_P<sub>EC\_nl</sub>_, hour); _T<sub>EC\_mid</sub>_ (¬∞C) is the midpoint of the logistic function reproducing the temperature effect. The function asymptote depends both on _PC<sub>EN</sub>_ and _Pr_. The figures below show the behaviour of these equations at two levels of endodormancy completion and different day lengths.

<figure>
  <p align="center">

 <figcaption align="center"><em>Photothermal units for ecodormancy progress.

</figure>

### Growing season
When _PC<sub>EC</sub>_ = 100%, the ecodormancy phase is completed and the growing season begins. 

#### Growth and greendown
Forcing thermal units (_TU<sub>GR</sub>_, day<sup>-1</sup>) are computed with the equation 11, which is taken from [Yan and Hunt, 1999](https://www.ggebiplot.com/Yan-Hunt1999a.pdf)


$$
TU_{\mathrm{GR}} = \left( \frac{T_{\mathrm{max}} - T}{T_{\mathrm{max}} - T_{\mathrm{opt}}} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{T - T_{\mathrm{min}}}{T_{\mathrm{opt}} - T_{\mathrm{min}}} \right)^{\frac{T_{\mathrm{opt}} - T_{\mathrm{min}}}{T_{\mathrm{max}} - T_{\mathrm{opt}}}}
$$

where _T<sub>min</sub>_, _T<sub>opt</sub>_ and _T<sub>max</sub>_ are the minimum, optimum, and maximum tree cardinal forcing temperatures (¬∞C). The growth and greendown phases are simulated as a function of _TU<sub>GR</sub>_ only.
The resulting function is drawn below.


<figure>
 <p align="center">
  <img src="./docs/images/TU_GR_doc.png"  width="400">
  </p>
  <figcaption align="center"><em>Forcing accumulation during growth, greendown and decline. The shades correspond to the 40-60<sup>th</sup> and 25-75<sup>th</sup> percentiles of the distribution generated with minimum temperature ranging from 3 to 7 ¬∞C, optimum temperature from 16 to 22¬∞C, and maximum temperature from 28 and 35 ¬∞C</em></figcaption>
</figure>

#### Decline
During the decline phenophase, the photothermal unit (_PTU<sub>DE</sub>_, day<sup>-1</sup>) is simulated as the weighted average of _TU<sub>GR</sub>_ and the photothermal unit for [dormancy induction](#dormancy-induction), whose relative contribution depends on the percentage completion of the decline phenophase _PC<sub>DE</sub>_ (%), as in the equation below.

$$
PTU_{\mathrm{DE}} = TU_{\mathrm{GR}} \cdot (1 - PC_{\mathrm{DE}}) + PTU_{\mathrm{DI}} \cdot PC_{\mathrm{DE}} \tag{13}
$$

When _PC<sub>DE</sub>_ = 100%, the growing season ends, and the dormancy season restarts.

### NDVI simulation
SWELL simulates the pixel-level  dynamic (_NDVI<sub>swell</sub>_, unitless) by integrating a daily NDVI rate (day<sup>-1</sup>) within a lower (_NDVI<sub>min</sub>_, unitless) and upper (_NDVI<sub>min</sub>_ + _NDVI<sub>amp</sub>_, unitless) limit:

$$
NDVI_{\text{swell}} = \begin{cases}
  NDVI_{\text{min}} & \text{if } \sum_{1}^{n} NDVI_{r} \leq NDVI_{\text{min}} \\
  \sum_{1}^{n} NDVI_{r} & \text{if } NDVI_{\text{min}} < \sum_{1}^{n} NDVI_{r} < NDVI_{\text{min}} + NDVI_{\text{amp}} \\
  NDVI_{\text{min}} + NDVI_{\text{amp}} & \text{if } \sum_{1}^{n} NDVI_{r} \geq NDVI_{\text{min}} + NDVI_{\text{amp}}
\end{cases}\tag{15}
$$

where _NDVI<sub>amp</sub>_ is the NDVI amplitude and _n_ are the days elapsed from simulation start. During the dormancy season, _NDVI<sub>swell</sub>_ decreases with cold temperatures (_NDVI<sub>r\_D‚Üì</sub>_), and increases when days are lengthening and forcing temperatures favour the awakening of the understory vegetation (_NDVI<sub>r\_D‚Üë</sub>_). The following equations are used for this purpose.

$$
NDVI_{D\downarrow} = \begin{cases}
  0 & \text{if } T \geq T_{\text{min}} + T_{\text{shift}} \\
  NDVI_{D\downarrow*} \cdot \frac{\left| (T_{\text{min}} + T_{\text{shift}}) - T \right|}{10} & \text{if } T < T_{\text{min}} + T_{\text{shift}}
\end{cases}\tag{16}
$$


$$
NDVI_{D\uparrow} = \begin{cases}
  NDVI_{D\uparrow*} \cdot TU_{\text{under}} & \text{if } T \geq T_{\text{min}} + T_{\text{shift}} \text{ and } Dl > Dl_y \\
  0 & \text{if } T < T_{\text{min}} + T_{\text{shift}} \text{ and } Dl > Dl_y
\end{cases}\tag{17}
$$

where _NDVI<sub>D*</sub>_ (unitless) and _NDVI<sub>D*</sub>_ (unitless) are pixel-specific parameters representing the minimum NDVI decrease and the maximum NDVI increase during the dormancy season; _T<sub>shift</sub>_ (¬∞C) represents the pixel-specific sensitivity of the understory vegetation to thermal cues; _TU<sub>under</sub> (day<sup>-1</sup>_) is the understory thermal unit, computed substituting _T<sub>min</sub>_ with _T<sub>min</sub>_ + _T<sub>shift</sub>_ (¬∞C) in the equation for  [forcing](#growth-and-greendown) accumulation; _Dl<sub>y</sub>_ (hours) is the day length of the previous day. On the first dormancy day, the NDVI at senescence is initialized, ensuring it doesn't fall below the minimum allowed value (_NDVI<sub>min</sub>_). When average temperature drops below T_min + T_shift, the endodormancy contribution is calculated using a scaled temperature deficit, modulated by the normalized distance to NDVImin. When day length is increasing and temperatures exceed the thermal threshold, the ecodormancy contribution is computed using thermal forcing units and scaled by the proximity of current NDVI to its maximum (_NDVI<sub>max</sub>_). The final daily _NDVI<sub>r</sub> during dormancy thus combines both endodormancy and ecodormancy contribution.

During the growth phenophase, the daily NDVI rate (_NDVI<sub>GR</sub>_, day<sup>-1</sup>) refers to the dominant plant species and increases as a function of _TU<sub>GR</sub>_ (day<sup>-1</sup>) and _PC<sub>GR</sub>_ (%), i.e., the percentage completion of the growth phenophase.

$$
 NDVI_{\text{GR}} = NDVI_{\text{GR*}} \cdot TU_{\text{GR*}} \cdot \frac{(100 - PC_{\text{GR}})}{100} 
$$

where _NDVI<sub>GR*</sub>_ (day<sup>-1</sup>) is a pixel-specific parameter corresponding to the maximum _NDVI<sub>swell</sub>_ increase during the growth phase. After reaching the seasonal peak, _NDVI<sub>swell</sub>_ decreases during the greendown phenophase (NDVIr,GD, equation 18), and is further reduced during the decline phase (NDVIr,DE, equation 19).
