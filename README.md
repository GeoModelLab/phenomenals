üìñ Overview

PhenoMeNals is an open-source framework for predicting grapevine yield, yield components, and quality traits using a phenology-aware approach. It integrates:

    Phenology modeling of the two-year grapevine reproductive cycle

    Ecophysiological response functions aligned with phenological phases

    Statistical modeling of dynamic cumulative "memory signals"

This hybrid approach captures carry-over effects from Year-1 through harvest (Year 0), providing biologically grounded predictions and insights into environmental influences.

    How It Works

Highlights

    üå± Two-season phenology model (dormancy + growing phases)

    üß† Cumulative memory signals derived from 8 ecophysiological functions:
    TempF, ColdF, HeatF, LightF, WindF, DiseaseF, VPDefF, DroughtF

    ‚öôÔ∏è Handles multicollinearity and uses stepwise feature selection (AIC)

    üìà Validated on multi-site, multi-variety datasets (R¬≤ consistently > 0.8)

    ü™ü Windows-only backend (cross-platform support planned)

Description

PhenoMeNals is designed for viticulture research and decision support, capturing the progressive effects of environmental cues on grapevine yield and quality.

The workflow:

    Calibrates a chill-forcing phenology model using BBCH phenological observations

    Simulates ecophysiological functions across the standardized phenological timeline (0‚Äì400 units spanning Year-1 and Year 0)

    Normalizes and weights signals by correlation strength with the target trait

    Aggregates signals into cumulative memory signals (PhenoMeNals)

    Predicts traits using multiple linear regression and leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV)

Installation

    ‚ö†Ô∏è Platform notice:
    PhenoMeNals currently runs only on Windows due to its compiled C# backend.
    Cross-platform support (macOS/Linux) is under development.

1. Install R

Ensure R (‚â• 4.0) is installed:
üîó https://cran.r-project.org/
2. Install Required R Packages

install.packages(c("devtools", "caret", "MASS", "data.table"))

3. Install PhenoMeNals from GitHub

devtools::install_github("YourOrg/PhenoMeNals")

Getting Started

PhenoMeNals includes two main functions:
1. phenologyCalibration()

Calibrates the phenology model using BBCH observations and weather data.
Example:

calib <- phenologyCalibration(
  weather_data = weather_df,
  referenceBBCH = bbch_df,
  sites = "COL",
  varieties = "Carmenere",
  iterations = 200
)

Output: calibrated phenology parameters for each site √ó variety.
2. runPhenomenals()

Runs the full prediction pipeline using the calibrated phenology and target traits.

results <- runPhenomenals(
  weather_data = weather_df,
  target_data = yield_df,
  start_year = 2006,
  end_year = 2021,
  rolling_window = 3,
  bin_size = 1,
  multicollinearity_threshold = 0.8,
  max_phenomenals = 4
)

Output: structured list with:

    Processed memory signals

    Predictor selection results

    Prediction metrics (R¬≤, RMSE, MAE, relative importance)

    Access documentation from R:

?phenologyCalibration
?runPhenomenals

How It Works

PhenoMeNals uses ecophysiological functions to track weather cue effects across phenophases:

    Phenology calibration: chill and heat accumulation (eq. 1)

    Signal normalization: sigmoid scaling (eq. 10)

    Weighting: by correlation with target traits (eq. 11)

    Memory signal aggregation: cumulative trajectories (eq. 12)
